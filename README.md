#### More Mercs 1.0

My little mod for Classic M&B.

### If you want to test:
1. Download [Mount and Blade 2008](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=mount+and+blade+2008) (Steam or no-Steam).
2. Download Python 2.X e.g.: [Python 2.7 release](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).
3. Download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (you can use MS Notepad if you are strong enough).
4. Download latest version Module System folder (MS_moremercs_vX) from Github.
5. Go to the Modules folder in game directory which is by default:  
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mount&Blade/Modules\" (for no-Steam version),  
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount and Blade\Modules" (for Steam version).
6. Duplicate the Native folder and change the name of the copy to: moremercs.
7. Open module_info.py in the Module System folder with notepad and point to the export_dir to the moremercs folder:  
   export_dir = ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Mount&Blade/Modules/moremercs" (for no-Steam version)  
   export_dir = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Mount and Blade/Modules/moremercs/"
   The forward slashes are used deliberately.
8. Run the build_module.bat file to apply all the changes to the moremercs module folder
9. Test
